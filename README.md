# omni-extension-flipbook

An extension for omnitool that adds a pseudo-3d flipbook based on the excellent [Vue Flipbook](https://github.com/ts1/flipbook-vue) module.

This extension adds

* A flipbook UI for browsing image sets
* A /createFlipbook chat command that turns all image results in the current chat into a browsable flipbook.
